# Sonar-Signal-Classification-for-Mine-Detection
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to distinguish between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (mine) and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

This project aims to build a machine learning model to distinguish between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (mine) and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a sonar return indicates a mine or a rock using machine learning.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 0.3

## Method

We used the Linear Regression model from the scikit-learn library to classify the sonar returns. The model achieved an accuracy of 76%.

## Usage

You can clone this project and run the Jupyter notebook to see the steps taken to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.
